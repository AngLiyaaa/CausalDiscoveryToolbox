# Causal Discovery Toolbox

Package for causal inference in graphs and in the pairwise settings. Tools for graph structure recovery and dependencies are included.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Diviyan-Kalainathan/CausalDiscoveryToolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Diviyan-Kalainathan/CausalDiscoveryToolbox)

It implements lots of algorithms for graph structure recovery (including algorithms from the __bnlearn__, __pcalg__ packages), mainly based out of observational data.

An example of application of the toolbox on the LUCAS dataset (on Lung cancer) using CGNNs can be found here : [jupyter-notebook](LUCAS_example/Discovery_LUCAS.ipynb)
