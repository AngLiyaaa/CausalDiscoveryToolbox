def precision_recall(target, prediction, low_confidence_undirected=False):
    r"""Compute precision-recall statistics for directed graphs.
    
    Precision recall statistics are useful to compare algorithms that make 
    predictions with a confidence score. Using these statistics, performance 
    of an algorithms given a set threshold (confidence score) can be approximated.
    Area under the precision-recall curve, as well as the coordinates of the 
    precision recall curve are computed, using the scikit-learn library tools.
    Note that unlike the AUROC metric, this metric does not account for class
    imbalance.

    Precision is defined by: :math:`Pr=tp/(tp+fp)` and directly denotes the
    total classification accuracy given a confidence threshold. On the other
    hand, Recall is defined by: :math:`Re=tp/(tp+fn)` and denotes  
    misclassification given a threshold.

    Args:
        target: Target graph, must be of ones and zeros, and instance of 
          either np.ndarray or nx.DiGraph.
        prediction: Prediction made by the algorithm to evaluate, must be 
          either np.ndarray or nx.DiGraph, but of the same type 
          than the target.
        low_confidence_undirected: Put the lowest confidence possible to 
          undirected edges (edges that are symmetric in the confidence score).
          Default: False
 
    Returns:
        aupr_score: the area under the precision recall curve
        precision_recall_points: tuple of data points precision-recall used 
                                 in for the area under the curve computation.

        >>> # adjacency matrixes of size 10x10
        >>> aupr, curve = precision_recall(target, input) 
        >>> # leave low_confidence_undirected to False as the predictions are continuous
